useMemo hook in React and what is its purpose?


Given a sorted array, find the smallest positive integer that is not the sum of a subset
of the array in O(N) time. For example, for the input [1, 2, 3, 10], the output should be
7.

Given the code: let a = true; setTimeout(() => { a = false; }, 2000) while(a) { console.log(’
-- inside while -- ’); } What will be printed to the console? Explain the output.

What will be the output of the following code? function foo() { console.log(a); }
function bar() { var a = 3; foo(); } var a = 5; bar();

Given a nested array, flatten it into a single array. For example, input: [[[1, 2, 3], 4, 5],
6, 7, [[8, 9], 10]], output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].

Given an integer array A of size N and an integer B, you can pick B elements from
either the left or right end of the array A to get the maximum sum. Find and return
the maximum possible sum. For example, if A = [5, -2, 3, 1, 2] and B = 3, the output
should be 8.

Given an array nums of size n, return the element that appears more than
n / 2
times. You may assume that the element always exists in the array. For example, for
the input [3, 2, 3], the output should be 3.

What will be the output of the following code? console.log([] == ![]); const arr = [10, 12,
15, 21]; for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) { setTimeout(function() { console.log(’Index: ’ +
i + ’, element: ’ + arr[i]); }, 3000); }

Given an integer array A containing N distinct integers, find all the leaders in the
array A. An element is a leader if it is strictly greater than all the elements to its right
side. The rightmost element is always a leader. For example, for the array [16, 17, 4,
3, 5, 2], the leaders are [17, 5, 2].
