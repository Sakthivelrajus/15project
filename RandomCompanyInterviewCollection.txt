In recent reactjs machine coding round, this was asked. Can you solve this ?

1. Create a react component that displays a timer with initial value 0.
2. There should be two buttons one to start/stop, and other to reset timer.
3. Clicking on start will start timer from 0 and increase timer value by 1 for every second and button text should change to "stop".
4. Clicking on stop will pause the timer and change button text to "start".
5. Now click on start then timer should continue from paused value.
6. Clicking on reset will reset the timer to initial value 0.

ðŸš€ Just solved a fun JavaScript machine coding round question! ðŸ’¡ This exercise really helped me solidify my understanding of React component lifecycle and setTimeout.

Here's the challenge from Adarsha P C 's LinkedIn post:

Parent component âž–

Input box: Enter a statement (e.g. "How are you?")
Button: Pass the entered statement to the child component when clicked.
Child component âž–

Receive the incoming statement and display each word with a 2-second delay on screen.

âž– The output looks like this: "How --2sec delay-- are --2sec delay-- you?"
